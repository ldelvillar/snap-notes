                SnapNotes was born from a simple idea: note-taking shouldn't be complicated. 
                We believe that capturing your thoughts should be as quick and effortless as taking a snapshot. 
                That's why we created a straightforward, no-frills note-taking application that lets you focus 
                on what matters most - your ideas.
